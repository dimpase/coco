The command `sub' determines the subschemes (merged schemes,
fusion schemes) of a given scheme (given by its parameters, that is).
It tells what relations to merge, what the rank of the resulting
scheme is, and, in case that is 3, also the parameters (v,k,lam).
Its output can be used as input to the `aut' command.

Call of sub:
	sub if.nrs o.opt of.sub

The intersection number input has the format
b			(the number of diagonal classes X_i)
r_11,r_12,...,r_bb	(the numbers of orbits on X_i x X_j)
(s,s')(t,t')...		(the pairs of classes that are transposes)
nr_11			(the number of nonzero p_ijk with i in X_1 x X_1)
(i,j,k-p_ijk)...	(this number of values)
nr_12			(the number of nonzero p_ijk with i in X_1 x X_2)
...
nr_bb
(i,j,k-p_ijk)...

[Here p_ijk stands for {p_ij}^k.]

The option input is one of "","s","a","p","sp","ap".
An "a" requires the merging to be antisymmetric
(which is possible only if there are no nondiagonal symmetric
classes to start with).
A "s" requires the merging to be symmetric.
A "p" requires the merging to be primitive
(which is possible only if either it was primitive already,
or it had more than one diagonal class).

For the format of the output file of.sub, see the description
of the `aut' command.
Subconfigurations are given in order of decreasing rank.
