The command `inm' calculates the intersection numbers of a given
colour graph.

Call of inm:
	inm if.cgr options.opt of.nrs

The input file if.cgr is a binary file produced by the
command `cgr'.

The option input is used only when the number of orbits (diagonal
blocks) of if.cgr is larger than 1; in that case it specifies
the set of triples (n1,n2,n3) of three diagonal blocks for
which the corresponding p(i,j,k) have to be computed.
It is either empty: all triples,
or "ndg" (`not on diagonal'): all triples except for (m,m,m),
or "nrf" (`no repeated field'): all triples except for
  (m,m,l), (m,l,m), (l,m,m),
or an explicit list "(m1,m2,m3)(n1,n2,n3)...".

For the format of the output file of.nrs, see the description
of the `sub' command.

If of.nrs is followed by `!' then the intersection numbers
are sorted according to (i,j,k) and also given on stdout;
this applies even if of.nrs itself was omitted.
