coco - compute with coherent configurations
Author: I.A. Faradzev (in cooperation with M.H. Klin).
Unix port: A.E. Brouwer (aeb@cwi.nl)

Invocation:
	coco
or
	coco of
calls coco and sends the protocol to the listing file of (default coco.res).
During a run the listing file can be changed with the `new' command.

Help: the coco command `?' prints this file. For any coco command xxx, the
command `xxx?' prints the file xxx.doc with information on the command xxx.

Commands: coco recognizes the 7 commands
	aut, cgr, cosen, exp, ind, inm, sub.
These commands usually have some parameters indicating input and output files.
A trailing ! after a filename orders coco to list the contents of the
input file while reading it.
A single * as input file name tells coco to get its input from stdin,
usually the keyboard.
The input and output files have default extensions indicated by
    cosen      ind       cgr       inm       sub
.rep  ->  .gen  ->  .gen  ->  .cgr  ->  .nrs  ->  .sub

           exp                            aut
.gen, .gen  ->  .gen          .cgr, .sub  ->  *
For further information, see the documentation of the individual commands.

A run is terminated by typing the ^D character or by giving the `end' command.

Auxiliary commands: coco recognizes the 7 requests (auxiliary commands)
	, end, help, look, more, new, res.
The empty request does not do anything.
The request `help' is a synonym for `?'.
The request `more' runs a pager (currently "/usr/ucb/more") with
the arguments provided.
The request `look' is equivalent to `more of', where of is the
most recently produced output file.
The request `res' is equivalent to `more of', where of is the
current listing file.

If the environment variable COCO is defined then input files g.gen, r.rep and
s.str will be looked for in $COCO/gen, $COCO/rep and $COCO/str, respectively,
when not found in the present directory. Similarly, the executables and
help files are looked for in $COCO/bin and $COCO/doc.
