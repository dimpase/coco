The command `cgr' computes the colour graph for a given
permutation group.

Call of cgr:
	cgr g.gen options c.cgr

Here g.gen is an input file containing generators for the group G,
and c.cgr is an output file where the colour graph is written.
This output file is not for human consumption, but can be used
by the commands `aut' and `inm'.

The input file g.gen has the following format:
The first line gives the degree n, the second line gives the number
of generators r and the following r lines contain the generators.
The generators are in cycle form, with cycles of length 1 omitted.
Although there is no limit on (physical) input line length, a logical
line may be continued over more than one physical line by ending each
non-final part with `*'.
Restrictions: the entries are the numbers 0..(n-1); the orbits of the
group must be consecutive subintervals of this interval.
Example: the input
	5
	2
	(0,1,2,3,4)
	(0,1)
describes the symmetric group Sym(5) in its natural action.

The file options (usually a * will be given and the options read
from stdin) may contain:
		G transitive	G not transitive
no c.cgr given	o,rank		o,t,d,ot,od,list or ranks
c.cgr given	i,rank		t,d,list or ranks

o	The option "o" specifies that all suborbits should be listed
	explicitly; without the "o" option only the length and one
	representative is given.
i	The option "i" tells to output enough columns for `inm' to work
	(this works only if G is transitive); this yields a much smaller
	output file, which cannot be used by `aut'.
t	The option "t" ("triangular") selects only the pairs of blocks
	(i,j) with i<=j.
d	The option "d" ("diagonal") selects only the pairs of blocks (i,i).
In case you know the rank(s) of the representation, you may
specify them - it will speed up computations.
There are two allowed ways of specifying:
Either b lines, each a sequence of b ranks separated by comma's;
a 0 means that the corresponding block can be omitted.
Or a list of blocks: lines of the form
	(n1-m1[r1],m2[r2],...,mk[rk])
where n1 is the block number of the row, the mj are the block
numbers of the columns, and the (optional) rj gives the rank.
