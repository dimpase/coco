                       The COSEN Command
                       =================
                        
This command can produce the enumeration of the cosets of the
subgroup H=<h(1),...,h(k)> in the group G=<x1,...,xN|w(1),...,w(r)>,
where h(i) and w(i) are words in the alphabet x1,...,xN.
If the enumeration is successful then this command shows [G:H] and
can produce the permutation representation of G on the set of cosets of H.

    Format of the command COSEN
----------------------------------------------------------
cosen f1 f2 f3
  Here f1 means input file, f2 in the present version must equal
  * (if f3 is nonempty), f3 is the file that will contain the
  permutation representation of G on the set of cosets of H in G
  (if the enumeration is successful).
  The default extensions for f1 and f3 are .rep and .gen, respectively.


    Format of the input file:
----------------------------------------------------------
Number of the generators (i.e. N)
Number of the involutorial generators (Ninv)
Number k of the words h(i), which generate the subgroup H
h(1)
h(2)
...
...
h(i)
...
h(k)
Number r of the defining relations w(i)
w(1)
...
...
w(i)
...
w(r)

       How to write down the relations w(i) and the words h(i).
       --------------------------------------------------------
       
Each w(i) or h(i) is a word in the alphabet x1,...,xN. Each
letter xJ in this alphabet must be written just as J.
Each letter is a word.
Each word is a sequence of words. A (nontrivial) sequence of words is
(word1)D1,(word2)D2,...,(wordM)DM, where (wordI)DI::=wordI,...,wordI
repeated DI times. If DI=1 then it is possible to write just
wordI instead of (wordI)1.
Note that the DI are concrete numbers, not variables.

           About involutorial and noninvolutorial generators
           -------------------------------------------------
It is assumed that the first Ninv generators are involutorial.
For such generator xI the relation (xI)2 is redundant.

                               An example
                               ----------
The input file a5.rep for the enumeration of the cosets of a subgroup
H=Sym(3) in the group G=Alt(5) follows. For other
examples see the files *.rep.

3           the number of generators G=<x1,x2,x3>
3           the number of the involutorial ones  xI*xI=1
2           the number of words, which generate the subgroup.
1           H=<x1,x2>
2           ...
4           the number of defining relations
(1,2)3      relations
(1,3)2      ...
(2,3)5      ...
(1,2,3)5    ...

If you type

cosen a5.rep

you will obtain [G:H]=10.
   
   
If you type

cosen a5.rep * tmp.gen

you will obtain also the file tmp.gen containing a permutation
representation of Alt(5) on the cosets of Sym(3).
