Heiko Theissen and Dima Pasechnik contributed some remarks
about the installation. COCO 1.0 compiled cleanly under SunOS,
but COCO 1.1 now also compiles on a Linux PC (i.e., with GNU tools).
In version 1.2 a bug concerning the writing of big generators
was fixed. Version 1.2a compiles on a recent Linux system.

coco assumes that you have an environment variable COCO
set to the full path of the COCO directory.

"make install" will move the driver program coco to your
bin directory $HOME/bin.

Heiko Theissen contributed the representation of J2 on 10080
points, constructed by Alexander Hulpke.

Dima Pasechnik fixed a long-standing bug in the subscheme search
reported in 1996 by Yuuji Suga and Akihiro Munemasa; the program produced
incorrect subschemes of the rank 23 scheme of the cyclic group Z_23.
